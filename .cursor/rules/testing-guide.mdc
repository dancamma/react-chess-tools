# Testing Guide for React Chess Tools

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for component testing.

## Test Setup

- [jest.config.js](mdc:jest.config.js) contains the Jest configuration
- [jest.setup.js](mdc:jest.setup.js) imports testing library extensions

## Writing Tests

Tests should be placed in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the components being tested:
- Test files should be named `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Components from react-chessboard need to be mocked

## Mocking Pattern

When possible, use external libraries (e.g. chess.js) without mocking them.

## Running Tests

```
npm test           # Run all tests
npm test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode
npm test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage report
```
