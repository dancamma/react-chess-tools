## Project Description

This project is a React-based chess game that allows users to play chess online. It is part of the `react-chess-tools` package and is designed to be easy to use and customizable. It is built on top of the `react-chessboard` and `chess.js` packages, and provides a nice default configuration for the chess game, including:

- Sounds
- Move-by-click
- Square highlighting
- Keyboard controls

It is build using an approach similar to the one used in the `radix-ui`, where the `ChessGame` component is built using a `ChessGameContext` that you can use to customize and ehance the component game. Is also provides a set of default components that you can use to build your next chess app.

## Preview

Visit the [demo](https://react-chess-tools.vercel.app/) to see the `react-chess-game` component in action.

## Installation

To install the `react-chess-game` package, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install @react-chess-tools/react-chess-game
```

## Usage

To use the `react-chess-game` package, you can import the `ChessGame` component and use it as follows:

```tsx
import { ChessGame } from "@react-chess-tools/react-chess-game";

const App = () => {
  <ChessGame.Root>
    <ChessGame.Board />
  </ChessGame.Root>;
};
```

## Documentation

The `react-chess-game` package provides a set of components that you can use to build your chess app. The following sections describe the components and their usage.

### ChessGame.Root

The `ChessGame.Root` component is the root component of the `react-chess-game` package. It is used to provide the `ChessGameContext` to the rest of the components. It also provides a set of default values for the `ChessGameContext` that you can customize. It instantiates a `Chess` instance using the `fen` prop and provides it to the `ChessGameContext`.

#### Props

The `ChessGame.Root` component accepts the following props:

| Name        | Type       | Default          | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| children    | React.FC   |                  | The children of the `ChessGame.Root` component. |
| fen         | string     | initial position | The FEN of the chess game.                      |
| orientation | "w" \| "b" | "white"          | The orientation of the chess game.              |

### ChessGame.Board

The `ChessGame.Board` component is the main component of the `react-chess-game` package. It is used to render the chess board and the pieces. It uses the `ChessGameContext` to get the `Chess` instance and the `orientation` of the game.

#### Props

All the props from Chessboard.js are supported. You can find the full list of props [here](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard#props).

### ChessGame.Sounds

The `ChessGame.Sounds` component is used to provide the sounds for the chess game. By default, it uses the sounds from the `react-chess-sounds` package, but you can provide your own sounds. Sounds must be provided as base 64 encoded strings.

#### Props

The `ChessGame.Sounds` component accepts the following props:

| Name     | Type   | Default | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| check    | string |         | The sound to play when a player is in check.      |
| move     | string |         | The sound to play when a player makes a move.     |
| capture  | string |         | The sound to play when a player captures a piece. |
| gameOver | string |         | The sound to play when the game is over.          |

### ChessGame.KeyboardControls

The `ChessGame.KeyboardControls` component is used to provide keyboard controls for navigating through the chess game. By default, it enables arrow key controls for moving through game history, but you can customize the key bindings.

#### Props

The `ChessGame.KeyboardControls` component accepts the following props:

| Name     | Type             | Default                 | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| controls | KeyboardControls | defaultKeyboardControls | Object mapping key names to handler functions. The default controls are: ArrowLeft (previous move), ArrowRight (next move), ArrowUp (go to start), ArrowDown (go to end) |
