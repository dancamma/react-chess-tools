# Welcome to react-chess-tools

Build beautiful, accessible chess applications in minutes with React components designed for real-world use.

## Why react-chess-tools?

Building chess applications involves more than just rendering a board. You need:

- Move validation and game state management
- User interaction (drag, click, keyboard)
- Visual feedback (highlights, arrows, last move)
- Audio feedback for moves
- Timing controls for competitive play
- Engine integration for analysis

**react-chess-tools** provides all of this with a composable, type-safe API.

## Quick Example

Get a fully functional chess board in just a few lines:

```tsx
import { ChessGame } from "@react-chess-tools/react-chess-game";

function App() {
  return (
    <ChessGame.Root>
      <ChessGame.Board />
      <ChessGame.Sounds />
    </ChessGame.Root>
  );
}
```

<Canvas of={ChessGameStories.WithSounds} />

That's it! You now have:

- A playable chess board with drag-and-drop
- Legal move validation
- Sound effects for each piece type
- Check/checkmate detection
